# blackjack
Quite litteraly, blackjack.

This little game I made in javascript is a blackjack to play in command prompt.

The game is in english, but the cards are in french (I wasn't really thinking of putting it on github).

It uses real rules of blackjack (if you have a 21, you instant win, if the dealer has a 21, he instant wins.)

The game, instead of using random every round, shuffles 6 decks of cards and play them until 60 cards are left, then re-shuffle (like in real casino).

Hope you'll like this game. Just launch the index.js, nothing required (except nodejs lol)
